This is a library for providing access to OpenPlatform 2.0.1' and 
GlobalPlatform 2.1.1 conforming smart cards.

You need also the libraries zlib 1.2.3 (zlib1.dll) and OpenSSL 0.9.7e 
(libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll) or compatible. Best is to place them 
in the system directory (C:\Windows\System32 or /usr/(local/)lib 
usually) or application directory.

If you compile this on your own:

On other Windows systems you may need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable 
Package. It may be the case that you need an older or a newer 
version like it is installed. Also if you get SideBySide errors the version is not correct. 
This is called DLL hell. 
Search for "vcredist_x86.exe" or use the following links and try to 
find the right version:

If you experience problems a DEBUG output is always helpful.
Set the variable GLOBALPLATFORM_DEBUG=1 in the environment. You can set  
the logfile with GLOBALPLATFORM_LOGFILE=<file>. Under Windows by 
default C:\Temp\GlobalPlatform.log is chosen. The log file must be 
writable for the user. The default log file under Unix systems is 
/tmp/GlobalPlatform.log. But usually syslog is available and this will 
be used by default, so you may have to specify the log file manually, 
if you don't have access to the syslog or don't want to use it. 
Keep in mind that the debugging output may contain sensitive information, 
e.g. keys!
