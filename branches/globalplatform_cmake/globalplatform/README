Title    : GlobalPlatform
Authors  : Karsten Ohme <k_o_@users.sourceforge.net>
License  : See file COPYING
Requires : PC/SC Lite http://www.musclecard.com/ (for UNIXes)
           OpenSSL http://www.openssl.org/
           zlib http://www.zlib.net/
******************************************************

This is a library for providing access to OpenPlatform 2.0.1' and
GlobalPlatform 2.1.1 conforming smart cards.

You need also the libraries zlib 1.2.3 (zlib1.dll in Windows) and OpenSSL 0.9.7e
(libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll in Windows) or compatible.

------------------

If you experience problems a DEBUG output is always helpful.
Set the variable GLOBALPLATFORM_DEBUG=1 in the environment. You can set
the logfile with GLOBALPLATFORM_LOGFILE=<file>. Under Windows by
default C:\Temp\GlobalPlatform.log is chosen. The log file must be
writable for the user. The default log file under Unix systems is
/tmp/GlobalPlatform.log. But usually syslog is available and this will
be used by default, so you may have to specify the log file manually,
if you don't have access to the syslog or don't want to use it.
Keep in mind that the debugging output may contain sensitive information,
e.g. keys!

If you compile this on your own:

Compilation under Unix
----------------------

You must have CMake installed. http://www.cmake.org/ 
This can be obtained in standard Unix distributions over the integrated package system.

On a command line type:

cd \path\to\globalplatform
cmake .
make


Compilation under Windows
-------------------------

-- Requirements --

Tested with:

**** SDK ****
Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924

**** VISUAL C++ 2010 EXPRESS ****
To have nmake install VISUAL C++ 2010 EXPRESS
http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express

**** OpenSSL ****
http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
--> Win32 OpenSSL v1.0.0d
--> Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables

**** zlib ****
http://www.zlib.net/
--> zlib compiled DLL, version 1.2.5

  * Copy the zlib1.dll to C:\Windows\System32
  * Copy the files from the include directory to
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Include
  * Copy the file "zdll.lib" from the lib directory to
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Lib

**** CMake ****
http://www.cmake.org/
--> CMake 2.8.4

**** Compile ****

  Launch Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)
  cd \path\to\globalplatform

  cmake .
  ## CMake looks for PC/SC, OpenSSL and zlib ##

  nmake

Done!

Source Packages
---------------

Execute:

make/nmake package_sourse

Binary Packages
---------------

Execute:

make/nmake package 

CMake Issues
------------ 

You must rebuild the build system if your build tools have changed. Otherwise 
CMake uses outdated values. You have to delete manually 
the CMakeCache.txt file (and maybe also the CMakeLists directory and 
cmake_install.cmake).

If your are using Cygwin and you have installed the GNU compiler tools and the
bin directory is on the PATH environment variable CMake will favor these tools 
and the linking step will fail. So remove the Cygwin bin directory from the path.  

------------------

Testing is only supported under Linux for now. To generate the tests execute:

cmake -DTESTING=ON
make
make tests

For the unit tests a JCOP v2.2 41 card is used.
